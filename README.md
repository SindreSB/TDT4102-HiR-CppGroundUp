Support code for a lecture in TDT4102

The examples are supposed to be read in the following order:
1) Preprocessor
2) Scope
3) Functions
4) WhyTypes
5) Types
6) initialization
7) Classes

Note that the Preprocessor example includes an addition configuration that will only preprocess and output to file. This sample is only to show the function of the preprocessor , to aid understanding of the use of header files.
